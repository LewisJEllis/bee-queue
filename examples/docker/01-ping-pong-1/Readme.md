# Ping-Pong for Bee-Queue in Docker

This example uses two queues whereby a job on the ping queue submits a job to the pong queue.
The code is taken directly from the [terminal-based ping-pong example](file:../../pingpong/README.md).

## Run it

The `./go.sh` script runs the example.
The `ping.js` process submits a ping job twice.
The `pong.js` process responds to each ping job by submitting a pong job.

Logged output shows the processing steps.
